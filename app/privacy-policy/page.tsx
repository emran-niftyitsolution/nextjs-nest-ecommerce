                                                <li>If we say 'policy' we're talking about this privacy policy. If we say 'user terms' we're talking about the rules for using each of the Sites. The rules vary by product and each product makes them separately available and seeks consent to them separately to this policy.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <h4>The type of personal information we collect</h4>

                                                <li>The most common types of information we collect include things like: user-names, member names, email addresses, IP addresses, other contact details, survey responses, blogs, photos, payment information such as payment agent details, transactional details, tax information, support queries, forum comments (if applicable), content you direct us to make available on our Sites (such as item descriptions), your actions on our Sites (including any selections or inputs into items) and web and email analytics data.

                                            <h4>How we collect personal information</h4>
                                            <ol start={6}>
                                                <li>We collect personal information directly when you provide it to us, automatically as you navigate through the Sites, or through other people when you use services associated with the Sites.</li>
                                                <li>We collect your personal information when you provide it to us when you complete membership registration and buy or provide items or services on our Sites, subscribe to a newsletter, email list, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication.</li>
                                                <li>
                                                    As the operator of digital content marketplaces, we have a legitimate interest in verifying the identity of our authors. We believe that knowing who our authors are will strengthen the integrity of our marketplaces by reducing fraud, making authors more accountable for their content and giving AliThemes and customers the ability to enforce contracts for authors who break the rules. AliThemes also has certain legal obligations that require us to know who our authors are in certain circumstances. In light of this, if you are an author we will verify your identity, in particular, your name, full address and date of birth by asking you to show us a Photo ID document. The verification procedure is called AliThemes Verify. AliThemes Verify
                                                    will be carried out by our service provider Jumio Corporation located at 395 Page Mill Road, Suite 150, Palo Alto, California, USA. As part of AliThemes Verify, you will be asked to take a selfie which will then be compared against your Photo ID document using facial recognition technology. We will use your Photo ID document solely to carry out AliThemes Verify and delete it after the completion of this process.
                                                </li>
